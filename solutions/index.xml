      <description>You have heard it said, &amp;ldquo;it is not how you start, but how you finish.&amp;rdquo; In the world of supply chain logistics, this is undoubtedly the case. The final stretch of the delivery process is no time to coast.
Along with being a key to customer satisfaction, last mile delivery can be the most expensive and time-consuming part of the entire shipping process. Today&amp;rsquo;s end-customer is more mobile savvy and less patient than ever before.</description>
